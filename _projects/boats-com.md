## Changing the direction

For boats.com we wanted to change a little bit the existing product. Previously it was a more generalist classified of boats for sell, but it has always a big amount of boats from manufacturers (OEM) and new boats.

The idea with the project was to focus more on that OEM and new boats market and make use of all the information that we had to create a more informative site for both new and experienced boaters.
